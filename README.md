# inventree-brotherqlwebapi-plugin

This is a fork of [inventree-brother-plugin](https://github.com/inventree/inventree-brother-plugin) to support printing on Brother printers via [brother_ql_web](https://github.com/tbnobody/brother_ql_web) API. Idea was that with this setup is also possible to print on cheaper USB printers without network connection.
